###### Goal: Verify Phone Number using WhatsApp code instead of SMS OTPs
---
Using SMS OTPs is the norm for phone number verification. And often a reason for bad user experience due to delays or non-delivery altogether. Twilio allows you to verify phone numbers through a WhatsApp code, without having to set up a WhatsApp Business account.
On the server side, you can use their [Verify WhatsApp](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/whatsapp) feature. However, in client-side libraries (I'm using NextJS), Twilio [recommends using Functions](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/node#server-side-only-not-front-end), rather than their Javascript library.
This blog post details how to setup Twilio functions and use them to verify phone numbers through WhatsApp in your React app.
For getting phone inputs from the user, I used the [react-phone-input-2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-phone-input-2).
This returns the phone number as a string, including the country code for the country selected. Here I update the `userDetails` object with the phone number entered by the user.
```ts
<span className='text-black text-left'>
    <PhoneInput 
    country={"us"}
    value={userDetails.phoneNumber}
    enableSearch={true}
    inputProps={{
        name: 'phoneNumber',
        required: true,
        autoFocus: true
        }}
    onChange={phone => updateUserDetails("phoneNumber", phone)} />
</span>
<div>
    <button onClick={props.fetchOtp}>Get WhatsApp Code</button>
</div>
```
The `fetchOtp` function calls an `api` route that will in turn call the relevant Twilio function.
```ts
async function fetchOtp(event: React.MouseEvent) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const res = await fetch('/api/twilio-send-code', {
      body: JSON.stringify({
          phone: userDetails.phoneNumber,
      }),
      headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      method: 'POST'
      });
    const result = await res.json();
    if (result.status == 200) {
      setCodeSent(true);
      console.log("this worked")
    } else {
      console.log("there was an error");
    }
    console.log(result)
    return result;
  };
```
To call the Twilio function using an `http` rquest directly in the `fetchOtp` function, you would need to [expose your Twilio credentials to the client](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables#exposing-environment-variables-to-the-browser). This is not recommended, hence, we call an api route that makes the `http` request to Twilio for us.
Ensure that your `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` is added to your `.env` file. The `Auth Token` can be found in your Twilio Console.

To set up the Twilio function to send a WhatsApp code to a phone number provided, you need to setup a new `Verify` service. On the left-hand navigation bar in Twilio, click on Explore products.

>![pin-verify-functions](/videos/twilio-verify-whatsapp/pin-verfiy-functions.mov)

In the `Verify` menu, select `Services` and click on the `+` to create a new service. Give it a name and keep only WhatsApp enabled in the Delivery Channels option. The code length is 6 digits by default, you can change this.

Let's setup a Function now. Go to `Functions` in the Twilio Console and select `Services` from the sub-menu. Create a new service.
